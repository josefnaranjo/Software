This project aims to provide the user with recommendations for games that fit the criteria given by the user. The data displayed contain information about video game titles such as title, genre, platform, studio, and year of release. 

'main.py' contains the menu from which the user will interact with the program. Depending on their first option, the program will take the user to another menu. Various methods are still under work and will continue to be improved as the semester advances. 

'commandline.py' has all the different functionalities the user will be interacting with after choosing an option from the main menu.

'game.py' contains the constructor method and the get and set methods for the parameters.

'gameInv.py' contains the list implementation for the Video game Retrieval System.

'abstract.py' has the abstract methods that work as "blueprints" for the Video game RS.

'gameInv_Dict.py' contains the dictionary implementation of the Video game Retrieval System using a Linked List.

'dictionaryLinkedList.py' has the code for the Linked List.

'gameInv_Hash.py' contains the dictionary implementation of the Video game Retrieval System using a Hash Table. 

'dictionaryHash.py' has the code for the Hash Table.

'gameInv_Sort' contains the dictionary implementation of the Video game Retrieval System using a Sorted List (it's not finished). 

'dictionarySortedList.py' has the code for the Sorting function.

'random_file.py' has a method to create a random file that contains random data that's used for the analysis of the Video game RS.

'rand_file_100.csv' contains 100 random entries.

'rand_file_500.csv'contains 500 random entries.

'rand_file_1000.csv' contains 1000 random entries.

'rand_file_10000.csv' contains 10000 random entries.

'vgList.csv' contains 40 video game entries. They are all different.

**Unit Tests were made for all get and set methods contained in game.py to ensure they functioned properly
